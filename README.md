# Redstarswebsite
I built a website for a fictional band named 'Red Stars' for Code Institute.
They wanted to the site to display their music, socials, photos, tell something about theirselves
and to let people contact them for events/questions.


## UX
This site is built especially for fans who want to listen to music or want to see photos from the Red Stars, 
which is easy accessable by clicking in the nav-bar.
Users who want to contact the management of Red Stars can also click top right, which guides them
to a form which they can fill in to submit any requests  for weddings/events etc.

## Features


### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - Easy navigation through navbar by clicking on the different links
- Feature 2 - Through scrolling easy navigation to tickets (with links), videos, latest photos, information about the band itself and socials.
- Feature 3 - Listen to the latest album on the music page by clicking on the MP3 files. Also easy downloadable by clicking on the three dots.
- Feature 4 - Cycle through concert photos, sorted by date&place by clicking on them and using cursor or arrows.
- Feature 5 - Easily contact the management by filling the form at the booking page.

## Testing

Tested the site in a lot of ways by clicking every button on every page. 
Checking all possibilities by filling in forms, clicking in different orders.
Did all this in different browsers.
And after each thing I wrote, i checked it on a lot of devices with various screen sizes, portrait and landscape.

I also sent it to 12 friends (some of them have experience with coding) whom I asked for feedback.
And ofcourse looked through it with my mentor, Ignatius Ukwuoma, from Code Insitute.

## Deployment
I pushed all the files to Github.com and it's now available on:
